## Description
This web page has two different functionalities to it, on the one side “Simple” you will only be allowed to choose from certain colors that are in the JavaScript. I put purple, pink, green, red, brown and you are able to rotate through these colors. On the nav, you can also choose the “Hex” page, in which the layout and function are the same but it actually randomizes which color you can pick based on the letters and numbers it gives you, it will specifically cover all the colors within the color hex. The background color hex will display every time you hit the button. 

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to randomly select a color so that the background color of the page can be changed.

## Technology Used
HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript, arrays, document.getElementById(), document.querySelector(), addEventListener(), document.body.style.backgroundColor, Math.floor(), Math.random(), & array.length.
